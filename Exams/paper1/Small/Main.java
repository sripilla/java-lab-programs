/* Breakdown:
Initialization: The variable i starts at 1.
Loop Condition: The loop will continue as long as i is less than or equal to 12, and it increments i by 2 in each iteration.
Iterations:
First iteration: i = 1
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Second iteration: i = 3
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Third iteration: i = 5
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Fourth iteration: i = 7
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Fifth iteration: i = 9
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Sixth iteration: i = 11
Condition if (i == 8) is false.
Seventh iteration: i = 13
The loop condition (i <= 12) is now false, so the loop ends.
Conclusion:
Throughout all the iterations, the condition if (i == 8) is never met. Therefore, the program does not execute the System.out.println(i); line, resulting in no output. */
