/* What is the output of the following code snippet?
*/

public class Solution1{
public static void main(String[] args){
byte x = 127;
x++;
x++;
System.out.print(x);
}
}

/*
The output of the provided code will be -128.

Hereâ€™s why:

In Java, the byte data type has a range of -128 to 127.
You initialize x with the value 127, which is the maximum value a byte can hold.
The x++ operation increments the value of x. After the first increment, x becomes 128, but 128 is outside the byte range, so it wraps around to the minimum value in the byte range, which is -128.
Thus, after the second x++, x is -128.

So, the final output of the program is:

-128.*/
