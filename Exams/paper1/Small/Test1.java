/*
Static Variable:

static int x; declares a static variable x of type int. Since x is a static variable and is not explicitly initialized, it will have the default value for integers, which is 0.
Static Method:

static void display() is a static method that prints the value of x. Since x has not been assigned a value, it remains 0.
Main Method:

In the main method, an instance of the class test is created with test t1 = new test();.
Even though t1 is an instance of test, display() is a static method and can be called using the class name or an instance reference. Here, itâ€™s called using the instance t1.
When t1.display() is called, it executes the display method, which prints the value of x.

Since x is 0, the output of the code snippet will be: 0*/
