Identify the correct restriction on static methods

A) they must access only static data
b) they can only call other static methods
C) they cannot refer to this or super
D) they can refer to this or super
E) they can call other methods present in the class to which  it belongs to 

ans: 
The correct restrictions on static methods are:

A) they must access only static data: Static methods can only directly access static variables and methods of the class. They cannot access instance variables or instance methods without an object reference.

C) they cannot refer to this or super: Static methods do not belong to any instance of a class, so they cannot refer to this or super, which are used to refer to the current instance or the parent class instance, respectively.

Summary of Correct Restrictions:
A is correct.
C is correct.
Other Options:
B) they can only call other static methods: This is not entirely correct; static methods can call both static and instance methods (provided they have an instance of the class).

D) they can refer to this or super: This is incorrect as mentioned.

E) they can call other methods present in the class to which it belongs to: While static methods can call other static methods, they can only call instance methods if an instance of the class is created.

Conclusion:
The correct restrictions are A and C.
